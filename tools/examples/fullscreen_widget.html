  customLayout gets automatically called when the viewport size changes. Override it to calculate your own anchor points and to update your objects.
  
  The responsive package provides the variable canvasCorners where you can access the top-left corner via canvasCorners.tl etc. Other variables provided
  are canvasCenter, canvasWidth, canvasHeight -- which are hopefully self-explanatory -- as well as canvasLeft, canvasTop, canvasRight, canvasBottom, which
  are the x-coordinate of the left and right edge of the canvas, and the y-coordinate of the top and bottom edge of the canvas, respectively.
